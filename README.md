##  Quick Start

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start the Streamlit application
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the Platform
1. Upload Dataset - Upload your CSV file through the web interface
2. Auto-Detection* - The system automatically identifies:
   - Target columns (outcome variables)
   - Protected attributes (demographic variables)
   - Task type (classification/regression)
3. Analysis - Comprehensive bias analysis is performed automatically
4. Results - View detailed reports with explanations and recommendations

##  Dataset Requirements

### Supported Formats
- **CSV files** with headers
- Minimum 2 columns (features + target)
- Recommended minimum 100 rows for statistical significance

### Expected Columns
The system automatically detects:
- Target Column: Keywords like `target`, `label`, `outcome`, `approved`, `hired`, etc.
- Protected Attributes: Keywords like `gender`, `race`, `age`, `ethnicity`, `religion`, etc.

### Sample Dataset Format
```csv
age,gender,race,income,education,approved
25,Male,White,50000,Bachelors,1
30,Female,Black,35000,Masters,0
22,Male,Hispanic,25000,High School,1
```

```

##  Limitations & Considerations

### Statistical Requirements
- Minimum sample size for reliable statistical testing
- Assumes independent and identically distributed data
- Requires sufficient representation of all demographic groups

### Bias Types Covered
- Focuses on common bias types in tabular data
- Does not cover all possible bias manifestations
- Complementary to domain-specific bias analysis

### Model Assumptions
- Uses logistic regression as baseline model
- Binary classification focus (multi-class support limited)
- Assumes features are correctly encoded
